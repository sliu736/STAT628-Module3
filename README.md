# STAT628-Module3


This project is part of the coursework for STAT 628 module 3, in which we explored the Yelp data, analysed the factors that may have influences on ratings of gyms, and make suggestions based on our exploration.

There are four folders providing more details for our main project: Data, Code, R shiny, Image.


## Files and Folders
- `\Data` contains the raw data and precessed data.

- `\Code` provides R code files for data I/O, data extracting/processing, texing processing, variable selecting, statistical analysing and suggestion output.

- `\Image` contains the plots we get through texing processing, variable selecting and statistical analysing.
